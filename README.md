# NEUR-V6-DATA

V6 Rendition of Neuresthetics Theory. This repository serves as a collection of documents and data related to the development of Neuresthetics Theory version 6, focusing on intersections between neuroscience, AI, consciousness, and related philosophical concepts.

## Overview

Neuresthetics is the practice of deliberately shaping neural architecture through objective, species-wide principles of brain organization and dynamics. Rather than passive reflection, it uses aggregated neuroscience data (connectomes, plasticity rules, network theory) to guide targeted behaviors that enhance integration, reduce fragmentation, and expand cognitive capacity.

All showcased papers are here at root with some supporting files in V6 which are reposted in papers.
